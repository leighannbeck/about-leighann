            <h3>Welcome to my about me page!</h3>
            <p>My name is Leighann, and I am currently working towards pursing a new career as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I have always been interested in web design and development. I am a very creative person and always considered my interest as a hobby rather than a feasible career path. But in the last several years I have realized that isn't the case. I have always wanted to find something I love as a career path, and I may be a little late to the party, but I finally made it to the place I truly believe I am supposed to be.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <div class="hobbies-text-container">
            <h3>Creative Outlets</h3>
            <p>I have many hobbies that provide a creative outlet and the chance to destress when the pressures of life start to bear down on me more. The primary outlet I have is creative writing. I don't just consider writing to be a good way to relax, but I've also found it to be very therapeutic. I firmly believe that media (such as music, television/movies, books, and other forms) have the ability to reach audiences in a way few other mediums can and that stories have the power to heal in some cases. Because of that belief, I often write about the things that touch me on a personal level most often.</p>
            <h3>Conventions</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite things to do is attend fan conventions. The first convention I ever attended was in Las Vegas, NV for the television show, <span class="media-title">The Vampire Diaries.</span> Since then, I have attended several comic conventions as well as specialized conventions (concentrating on one particular fandom). I enjoy attending panels and hearing from people involved in the media I love so much tell their stories. I also enjoy meeting the actors and sharing with them how their work has impacted me. It can be expensive to attend conventions, so I am not able to go as often as I would like, but that just makes the times I am fortunate enough to attend even more special.</p>

    <h1>Facts</h1>
    <p>I can see Leigh as a true doer—someone who steps up, takes responsibility, and delivers fast results. She has a kind and helping heart, always ready to support others. Leigh is also a wonderful communicator who understands both the strengths and weaknesses of her teammates, making her a great team player.

        Outside of work, Leigh is a big movie lover, especially when it comes to fantasy, horror, and vampire films. If you ever need a recommendation for a thrilling movie night, Leigh is definitely the one to ask!</p>


    <h1>Movie Recommendation</h1>
    <p>I highly recommend "Lokah: Chapter 1 – Chandra", a Malayalam dark-fantasy / superhero film — and it's especially inspiring for Leigh. With a strong female lead (Chandra), striking visuals, and a powerful story, it has all the elements that align with Leigh’s love for fantasy, horror and, yes, vampire‐/supernatural vibes.</p>

    <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
    <p>The movie is part of a new cinematic universe, featuring Chandra as a superheroine who stands up against massive odds — kind of like how Leigh steps up as a doer in our team.</p>
